    "This notebook explores the prediction Fire Radiative Power (FRP) using satellite data of Australian bushfires with a neural network. Weâ€™ll use the cleaned dataset from Question 1 and apply a PyTorch-based neural network to predict FRP. This notebook will include data preprocessing, training a neural network model, and evaluating its performance."
